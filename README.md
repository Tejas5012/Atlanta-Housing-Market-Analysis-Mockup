# Atlanta-Housing-Market-Analysis-Mockup
End-to-end housing market analysis using Excel, SQL, and Tableau. Covers data cleaning, querying, and interactive visualization of Atlanta housing trends (price, sqft, bedrooms, zipcode). Demonstrates full data workflow and insights in a professional dashboard.

** This project uses randomly generated mock data and does not represent actual market trends. To protect client confidentiality, all information has been fully anonymized, and no personal data is displayed. This mockup is intended solely for demonstration to clients and employers.**


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full workflow of housing market analysis using **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**.  
The dataset is a synthetic mockup modeled after Atlanta housing data, designed to showcase **data preparation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques** for clients and employers.

## Workflow

### 1. Excel – Data Cleaning & Calculated Fields
- Imported the dataset into Excel  
- Cleaned and standardized columns (dates, prices, square footage)  
- Created calculated fields such as:  
  - **Age of Home** → `=YEAR(TODAY()) - [Year Built]`  
  - **Price per Square Foot**  
  - **Bedroom-to-Bathroom Ratios**

### 2. SQL – Data Structuring & Queries
- Set up a relational database (**MySQL**)  
- Created tables with appropriate data types (`INT`, `FLOAT`, `DATE`, etc.)  
- Practiced SQL queries for insights:  
  - Average housing prices by ZIP code  
  - Trends in prices over time  
  - Filtering by home condition, grade, and view  

### 3. Tableau – Data Visualization & Dashboards
- Connected Tableau to the dataset  
- Built key visualizations:  
  - Average Home Price by ZIP Code  
  - Price Trends Over Time  
  - Distribution of Home Conditions  
  - Price vs. Square Footage Scatterplot  
- Combined visualizations into an **interactive dashboard** for storytelling

## Key Insights (from mock data)
- Larger homes do not always correlate with higher prices  
- Location (**ZIP code**) has a stronger effect on price than square footage  
- Homes with better **conditions/grades** show a visible premium in pricing

## Tools Used
- **Excel** → Data cleaning & calculated fields  
- **SQL (MySQL)** → Database creation & querying
